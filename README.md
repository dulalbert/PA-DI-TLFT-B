# PA-DI-TLFT-B

This project contains the code to create a Dialogflow chabot, using data from Surfine ([href](https://www.surfline.com)) to answer basic questions about the wave and weather.
The chatbot is able to do small talk and give you today's wave, wethaer, wind, tides and sunligths. In a future version, it's whished to add recommendation about surf spots around and advices depending on the user level.

This is a demostration of what it is able to do for now:
